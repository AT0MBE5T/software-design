Rules
Goal of the game: Open all the safe (mine-free) cells on the playing field without opening any of the mine cells.
Playing field: The playing field is a grid of square cells. Each cell can have a mine, or a number showing the number of mines around that cell.
Start of the game: The game starts with all the squares on the field hidden from the player. The player chooses any square to start the game.
Player moves:
When a player opens a cell, the following actions can occur:
If there is no mine in the cell, a number is displayed showing the number of mines around that cell.
If there is a mine in the cell, the game ends and the player loses.
If there are no mines around the opened cell, all neighboring cells are opened, and the process is repeated for each of them.
The player can also mark a cell with a flag to indicate that they believe that cell contains a mine.
Victory and defeat:
The player wins when all safe cells are open (all mines are flagged).
A player loses when he opens a cell with a mine.
